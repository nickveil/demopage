  			<h2>Buzz</h2>
  			<h3>My friends call me Buzz Lightyear</h3>
  			<p>This is our dog Buzz. My son named him after the lead character in is favorite movie, Toy Story. He is an 11 year old Pug and is enjoying his retirement years. He spends most of his time finding the right spot to sleep... Somewhere near a window with his head propped up on someones shoes. In his glory days, he could give the UPS driver the riot act and made sure to make anyone who entered left the house think twice about returning. His preferred method was to wait until the glass door closed and give chase towards the door barking and howling as loud as he could. Now, he chooses only to get excited when he hears the bag of treats open up. </p>

  			<h2>Bella</h2>
  			<h3>The new gaurd dog</h3>
  			<p>Bella is a recent addition to our family. She came to us via the <a href="http://www.homes4pets.org/petsmart.htm">Danville-Boyle County Humane Society</a>. She is a ball of energy with a bark that can make your heart stop. She fits the saying "bark is worse than her bite". She will bark at anyone approaching the front door, but as soon they come into see her, she runs and hides (usually behind the couch) and waits out the visit there. she hasn't quite figured why the old dog is allowed so much freedom to roam around the house. Especially after she's destroyed numerous shoes and cell phone chargers.</p>
